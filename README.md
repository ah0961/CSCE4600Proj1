# CSCE4600Proj1
Project 1 for CSCE 4600

As of now, the three implemented scheduling processess SJF, SJFP, and RR do not run properly but have been implemeneted following the example provided for FCFS and the logic for each distinct scheduling process. There has also been comments provided in each process to show an understanding of my thinking for each section of code.
